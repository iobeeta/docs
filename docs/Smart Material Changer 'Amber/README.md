[PDF Document](https://iobeeta.github.io/docs/Smart%20Material%20Changer%20'Amber/Smart%20Material%20Changer%20%27Amber.pdf)

## Introduction

- It's based on script configuration instead of notecard. Faster loading/transfer speed, edits freely.
- Kernel and product functions are separated. Can support menu, HUD form, local and remote control.
- Easy to extend and no bound.
- Intelligent matching rules.

Ps: Notecard is not used for configuration because it loads too slow, so fucking slow, so fucking fucking ... slow.

## Script list

### Sender (KERNEL)

| Script | description |
|---|---|
| SMC.KERNEL | Kernel, Material Manager, Memory. |
| .SMC | Configuration for KERNEL. |

### Client (loader)

| Script | description |
|---|---|
| SMC.Client | Material matching applicator. Place it into the object which material needs to be replaced. Get messages from Kernel |
| .SMC.Client | Configuration for SMC.Client |

### Others

| Script | description |
|---|---|
| SMC.HUD.TRIGGER | For HUD, Replace Linkset material in PART.SET format with description of the Prim  |
| SMC.Menu | Replace material by clicking on the pop-up menu and selecting PART and SET. |
| .SMC.Menu | Configuration for SMC.Menu |

## Scripting relationships

**Put ".SMC" and "SMC.KERNEL" together.**

![Server/KERNEL](img/server.png)

**Put ".SMC.Client" and "SMC.Client" together.**

![Client](img/client.png)

**Put ".SMC.Menu" and "SMC.Menu" together, and they must be accompanied by KERNEL.**

![Menu](img/remote-menu.png)

## Configuration files

All parts in the red box can be edited.

**.SMC**

![.SMC](img/SMC-config.png)

**.SMC.Client**

![.SMC.Client](img/SMC-Client-config.png)

**.SMC.Menu**

![.SMC.Menu](img/SMC-Menu-config.png)

## Deployment

### Remote control

![remote control](img/remote-control.png)

### Local control

![local control](img/local-control.png)

### Multiple

- **Multiple SMC.Clients can be placed in different prims in the same linkset, and they can work for their own parts, controlled by one or more SMC.KERNELs.**
- **Multiple sets of SMC.KERNEL + SMC.Client can be placed in different prims in the same linkset to control multiple sets of rules with by local.**

![remote/local control and multiple](img/remote-local-control-&-multiple.png)

### Remote/Local Multiple Cross

**Multiple deployment and cross control**

- **Use REMOTE, LOCAL for pairing between SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client, Allow one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many.**
- **Multiple KERNEL control ranges are allowed to intersect, e.g., controlling mapping and color.**

![remote/local control and multiple cross control](img/remote-local-multiple-cross-control.png)

## Quick Start

### Menu application

Implement material replacement directly on the object through a menu.

| Perpare ||
|---|---|
| ![prepare object](img/prepare-object.png) | ![prepare textures](img/prepare-texture.png) |
| Prepare a linkset containing three 6-sided boxes. | Prepare three textures to be used for changing the diffuse. |

Planning to replace all faces of the box within the red outline, the faces of the box within the green outline, and the faces of the box within the yellow outline. Let them to switch between **red**, **green**, and **blue** diffuse textures.

**In edit mode, use the face selector to view the face numbers.**

| Rename prims |||
|---|---|---|
| ![rename red](img/prepare-named-1.png) | ![rename green](img/prepare-named-2.png) | ![rename yellow](img/prepare-named-3.png) |
| Rename the prim to "ONE" | Rename the prim to "TWO" | Rename the prim to "THREE" |

Now, there are faces that can be precisely located:

- **All faces** of the prim named **"ONE"**
- Face **0** of the prim named **"TWO"**
- Face **4** of the prim named **"THREE"**

| Place the script |
|---|
| ![prepare scripts](img/prepare-script.png) |
| Drag and drop the required script. |

Due to using the menu mode, KERNEL, Client, Menu, and their configuration files will all be placed into the "Contents" of the object.

| Edit .SMC |
|---|
| ![config part](img/config-part.png) |
| Define all the parts and give them names. <br>The definition of **PART** is similar to a **selector** or **locator**, describing how to find the target face. |
| ![config set](img/config-set.png) |
| Define three textures for different colors and give them names.<br>Each PART will switch between three styles, so all three variations need to be fully specified. |

| Edit .SMC and .SMC.Client |
|---|
| ![config local](img/config-local.png) |
| Adjust LOCAL to the same non-zero value. |

| Edit .SMC.Menu |
|---|
| ![config menu](img/config-menu.png) |
| Set TOUCH = 1, Enable touch. |

| Try ||
|---|---|
| ![menu pop-up](img/menu-default.png) | ![apply](img/menu-default-2.png) |

<!-- ## User guide

Common applications

### Menu application

Click on the object, linkmessage, or gesture to bring up the menu and choose to replace the material.

- Prepare a target object to be replaced material, such as perm, mesh, or linkset.
- Put in scripts
  - SMC.KERNEL
    - .SMC
  - SMC.Client
    - .SMC.Client
  - SMC.Menu
    - .SMC.Menu
- Edit configuration information in .SMC, .SMC.Client, .SMC.Menu.
- Change the name or descrition of the Prim.
- (Recommended) **.SMC.Client**、**.SMC.Menu** You can delete it after saving it, or putting it into an object.
- (Recommended) input **/finalise** in local chat, fix the KERNEL configuration, then you can delet **.SMC**.
- Click the object to use.

**The"LOCAL" in .SMC and .SMC.Client must be the same.**

### HUD application

Material change via HUD communication with target object, remote control.

- Prepare an object as the HUD.
- Put in script
  - SMC.KERNEL
    - .SMC
  - (options) **SMC.HUD.TRIGGER**，A sample HUD Button Click Trigger.
    - Write the defined PART and SET in the description of the HUD's buttons. Separated each by ".", such as **PartA.Style1**. The SET must be set, and the PART can be omitted. If without PART, such as：**.Style1**,the script will replace all the PART with **Style1**.
    - You can develop the trigger script for HUD, for more functions, such as slider and color picker.
- Edit configuration information in **.SMC**
- (Recommended) input **/finalise** in local chat, fix the KERNEL configuration, then you can delet **.SMC**.
- Prepare another target object to be replaced material, such as perm, mesh, or linkset.
- Put in script
  - SMC.Client
    - .SMC.Client
- (Recommended) Edit configuration in **.SMC.Client**，you can delet it after saving or putting into object.
- Rename the prim of linkset.
- Click the HUD to use.

**The "REMOTE" in .SMC and .SMC.Client must be the same.**

### Remote Menu

Another type of remote control, base on menus instead of HUDs.

- Prepare an object that can trigger the menu
- put in scripts
  - SMC.KERNEL
    - .SMC
  - SMC.Menu
    - .SMC.Menu
- edit configuration in .SMC and .SMC.Menu
- (Recommended) **.SMC.Menu** You can delete it after saving it, or putting it into an object.
- (Recommended) input **/finalise**in local chat，fix the KERNEL configuration, then you can delet **.SMC**.
- Prepare another target object to be replaced material, such as perm, mesh, or linkset.
- Put in script
  - SMC.Client
    - .SMC.Client
- (Recommended) Edit configuration in **.SMC.Client**，you can delet it after saving or putting into object.
- Rename the prim of linkset.
- Click the HUD to use.

**The "REMOTE" in .SMC and .SMC.Client must be the same.** -->

## Scenario example

**A suit with HUD**

- Put SMC.KERNEL into the HUD.
  - SMC.HUD.TRIGGER is optional. And it's flexible to write if you know about LSL script.
- Put SMC.Client into the suit.
- Make sure the same REMOTE in both SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client.

**A suit, with menu pops up when click on the collar**

- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Client、SMC.Menu into the suit。
  - You can put these scripts in ROOT or collar. That depends on where you want the menu pops up by click.
- Make sure the same LOCAL in both SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client.

**A house, with control pad. And the house and pad is linked. Menu pops up when click on.**

- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Client into any PRIM of the house. Set the same LOCAL for both.
- Put the SMC.Menu into the control pad, and ture on the TOUCH.

**A house, with control pad. And the house and pad isn't linked. Menu pops up when click on.**

- Put SMC.Client into any PRIM of the house.
- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Menu into the control pad and turn on the TOUCH.
- Make sure the same REMOTE in both SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client.

**A house with 2 control pads. One is linked to the house. Another one is in your inventory, works as HUD.**

- Put SMC.Client、SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Menu into any PRIM of the house, and turn on the TOUCH.
- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Menu into the linked control pad, and turn on the TOUCH.
- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Menu into the portable control pad HUD.
- Make sure the same LOCAL in both SMC.Client and SMC.KERNEL.
- Make sure the same REMOTE in all the SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client.

*Attention! **SMC.HUD.TRIGGER** only works with independent **PRIM** buttons **HUD**. It depends on different name and description. It will not work with only one **PRIM**, since it **can not** recognize the touch position **(ST/UV)**. If need such function, you could write your own script.*

## Configure

### .SMC

| Configuration | Type | Value | Default | description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEBUG | integer | 0 / 1 | 0 | Debug mode, when enabled, outputs more information |
| LOCAL | integer | -2147483648 ~ 2147483647 (0 invalid) | 0 | Local communication channels, mostly used in menu format |
| REMOTE | integer | -10000 ~ 10000 | 0 | Remote Communication Channel Offset（Note: This is private channel offset, not the exact channel），mostly used in HUD format |
| CACHE | integer | 0/1 | 0 | Resource buffer(UUID).If there are a lot of reused images in the configuration, we recommend turnning this. It could save much RAM |
| RANGE | integer | 0/1/2/3 | 0 | Control distance，0:10m, 1:20m, 2:100m, 3:all region |
| LINES | list |  |  | Detailed writing rules will be described below |

#### LINES

##### PART

Part/Target/Picker

- PART is one or many targets (prim & face), which material could be changed.It's also like a picker.
- There must be **4 parameters** after the PART.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "{name}", {matching type}, "{matching text}", {face(es)}
];
```

| Parameters | Type | Value | description |
|---|---|---|---|
| name | string | any | In a set of LINES configurations, it's not repeatable. This is one of the keys to change material. It will also work as option in local menu format |
| matching type | integer | table below | Describe the type of match |
| matching text | string/integer | any | Name or description for matching, to define with parameter 2 |
| face(es) | string/integer | -1~7/"01234567"/ALL_SIDES | Which face of the target PRIM. Then number of PRIM(0-7).<br>It could transfer string such as "0267". It will match mutiple face. And no need to follow the order, but can not be repetitive.<br>You can also use ALL_SIDES(-1),and no more face then, since ALL_SIDES include every face |

**Matching type**

| Constant | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FULL | 0 | Match full text of the PRIM name |
| PREFIX | 1 | Match the prefix of the PRIM name |
| SUFFIX | 2 | Match the suffix of the PRIM name |
| SMART | 3 | (temporarily unavailable) Intelligent matching of PRIM names |
| CONST | 4 | In the manner of constants in SL. The matching text could be: LINK_SET, LINK_ALL_CHILDREN, LINK_ALL_OTHERS, LINK_ROOT, LINK_THIS |
| DFULL | 10 | Match full text of the PRIM description |
| DPREFIX | 11 | Match the prefix of the PRIM description |
| DSUFFIX | 12 | Match the suffix of the PRIM description |
| DSMART | 13 | (temporarily unavailable) Intelligent matching of PRIM description |

**Examples**

Match the **3,4** faces of PRIM with named "**A**".

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "Part A", FULL, "A", "34"
];
```

Match **ALL** faces of the PRIM with prefix named **Rect**.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "All part starting with Rect", PREFIX, "Rect", ALL_SIDES
];
```

Match the **0** face of the PRIM with suffix named **3**.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "All part ending with 3", SUFFIX, "3", 0
];
```

Match the **1、2、5** faces of the "**PRIMs other than the one where the script in**".

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "All others", CONST, LINK_ALL_OTHERS, "125"
];
```

Match **ALL** faces of the PRIM with **description suffix "top"**.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "TOP", DSUFFIX, "top", ALL_SIDES
];
```

##### SET

Color/Theme/Material scheme

- SET is a material scheme, and free to configure.
- The definition of SET cannot be independent.**It must be behind a part**.
- There are many properties in a SET. The amounts of properties parameters are different.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, ...,
  SET, "{name}", {property}, {values...}, {property}, {values...}
];
```

### Submit

**-643323390**

Apply a predefined property to a predefined part and support custom append and override

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "{PART}�{SET}[�{DATA...}]", "");
```

- PART and SET must be defined in the configuration, and SET must belong to PART for this commit to work.
- The DATA part is an append or override attribute, written as in SET, optional parameters.

Examples

```lsl
// Most commonly used (using predefined configuration LINES)
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "TOP�BLACK", "");
// with customized properties
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "TOP�BLACK�6�<1.0, 0.0, 0.0>�9�TRUE�4�ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c", "");
// Easy style
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, llDumpList2String(["TOP", "BLACK", 6, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, 9, TRUE, 4, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
// It is recommended to use constants, which can be written as
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, llDumpList2String(["TOP", "BLACK", C, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, F, TRUE, S, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
```

\* Batch mode

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "�{SET}", "");
```

- If with no PART, the full match mode will be triggered at this point, and all PARTs containing the SET will be automatically found, and work together.
- The DATA appended at this moment, will be applied to all relevant PARTs.

Examples

```lsl
// In the defined PART, such as TOP, MIDDLE and BOTTOM.
// If there is BLACK in TOP and MIDDLE, those will be found automatically and BLACK will be applied.
// The same with carrying out TOP�BLACK and MIDDLE�BLACK
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "�BLACK", "");
```

**-643323392**

Apply a customized set of attributes to predefined parts

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323392, "{PART}�{DATA...}", "");
```

- PART must have been defined in the configuration for this commit to work.
- The writing style of DATA, such as properties in SET, is different with those above for the custom properties of PART.

Examples

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323392, "TOP�6�<1.0, 0.0, 0.0>�9�TRUE�4�ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c", "");
// Easy style
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323392, llDumpList2String(["TOP", 6, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, 9, TRUE, 4, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
// It is recommended to use constants, which can be written as
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323392, llDumpList2String(["TOP", C, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, F, TRUE, S, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
```

**-643323393**

Apply a set of custom properties to a customized part.

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323393, "{DATA...}", "");
```

- DATA must be with the full PART + SET contents.
- No need to follow the configuration, this is a completely independent selection + properties rule.

Examples

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323393, "2�top�0123�6�<1.0, 0.0, 0.0>�9�TRUE�4�ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c", "");
// Easy style
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323393, llDumpList2String([2, "top", "0123", 6, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, 9, TRUE, 4, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
// It is recommended to use constants, which can be written as
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323393, llDumpList2String([SUFFIX, "top", "0123", C, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, F, TRUE, S, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
