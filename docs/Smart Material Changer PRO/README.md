# Smart Material Changer PRO

Version: 1.8

## Introduction

- It's based on script configuration instead of notecard. Faster loading/transfer speed, edits freely.
- Kernel and product functions are separated. Can support menu, HUD form, local and remote control.
- Easy to extend and no bound.
- Intelligent matching rules.

Ps: Notecard is not used for configuration because it loads too slow, so fucking slow, so fucking fucking ... slow.

## Script list

### Sender (KERNEL)

| Script | description |
|---|---|
| SMC.KERNEL | Kernel, Material Manager, Memory. |
| .SMC | Configuration for KERNEL. |

### Client (loader)

| Script | description |
|---|---|
| SMC.Client | Material matching applicator. Place it into the object which material needs to be replaced. Get messages from Kernel |
| .SMC.Client | Configuration for SMC.Client |

### Others

| Script | description |
|---|---|
| SMC.HUD.TRIGGER | For HUD, Replace Linkset material in PART.SET format with description of the Prim  |

### Remote/Local

**Multiple deployment**

- **Multiple SMC.Clients can be placed in different prims in the same linkset, and they can work for their own parts, controlled by one or more SMC.KERNELs.**
- **Multiple sets of SMC.KERNEL + SMC.Client can be placed in different prims in the same linkset to control multiple sets of rules with by local.**

![remote/local control and multiple](img/remote-local-control-&-multiple.png)

### Remote/Local cross

**Multiple deployment and cross control**

- **Use REMOTE, LOCAL for pairing between SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client, Allow one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many.**
- **Multiple KERNEL control ranges are allowed to intersect, e.g., controlling mapping and color.**

## User guide

Common applications

### Menu application

Click on the object, linkmessage, or gesture to bring up the menu and choose to replace the material.

- Prepare a target object to be replaced material, such as perm, mesh, or linkset.
- Put in scripts
  - SMC.KERNEL
    - .SMC
  - SMC.Client
    - .SMC.Client
  - SMC.Menu
    - .SMC.Menu
- Edit configuration information in .SMC, .SMC.Client, .SMC.Menu.
- Change the name or descrition of the Prim.
- (Recommended) **.SMC.Client**、**.SMC.Menu** You can delete it after saving it, or putting it into an object.
- (Recommended) input **/finalise** in local chat, fix the KERNEL configuration, then you can delet **.SMC**.
- Click the object to use.

**The"LOCAL" in .SMC and .SMC.Client must be the same.**

### HUD application

Material change via HUD communication with target object, remote control.

- Prepare an object as the HUD.
- Put in script
  - SMC.KERNEL
    - .SMC
  - (options) **SMC.HUD.TRIGGER**，A sample HUD Button Click Trigger.
    - Write the defined PART and SET in the description of the HUD's buttons. Separated each by ".", such as **PartA.Style1**. The SET must be set, and the PART can be omitted. If without PART, such as：**.Style1**,the script will replace all the PART with**Style1**.
    - You can develop the trigger script for HUD, for more functions, such as slider and color picker.
- Edit configuration information in **.SMC**
- (Recommended) input **/finalise** in local chat, fix the KERNEL configuration, then you can delet **.SMC**.
- Prepare another target object to be replaced material, such as perm, mesh, or linkset.
- Put in script
  - SMC.Client
    - .SMC.Client
- (Recommended) Edit configuration in **.SMC.Client**，you can delet it after saving or putting into object.
- Rename the prim of linkset.
- Click the HUD to use.

**The "REMOTE" in .SMC and .SMC.Client must be the same.**

### Remote Menu

Another type of remote control, base on menus instead of HUDs.

- Prepare an object that can trigger the menu
- put in scripts
  - SMC.KERNEL
    - .SMC
  - SMC.Menu
    - .SMC.Menu
- edit configuration in .SMC and .SMC.Menu
- (Recommended) **.SMC.Menu** You can delete it after saving it, or putting it into an object.
- (Recommended) input **/finalise**in local chat，fix the KERNEL configuration, then you can delet **.SMC**.
- Prepare another target object to be replaced material, such as perm, mesh, or linkset.
- Put in script
  - SMC.Client
    - .SMC.Client
- (Recommended) Edit configuration in **.SMC.Client**，you can delet it after saving or putting into object.
- Rename the prim of linkset.
- Click the HUD to use.

**The "REMOTE" in .SMC and .SMC.Client must be the same.**

## Scenario example

**A suit with HUD**

- Put SMC.KERNEL into the HUD.
  - SMC.HUD.TRIGGER is optional. And it's flexible to write if you know about LSL script.
- Put SMC.Client into the suit.
- Make sure the same REMOTE in both SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client.

**A suit, with menu pops up when click on the collar**

- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Client、SMC.Menu into the suit。
  - You can put these scripts in ROOT or collar. That depends on where you want the menu pops up by click.
- Make sure the same LOCAL in both SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client.

**A house, with control pad. And the house and pad is linked. Menu pops up when click on.**

- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Client into any PRIM of the house. Set the same LOCAL for both.
- Put the SMC.Menu into the control pad, and ture on the TOUCH.

**A house, with control pad. And the house and pad isn't linked. Menu pops up when click on.**

- Put SMC.Client into any PRIM of the house.
- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Menu into the control pad and turn on the TOUCH.
- Make sure the same REMOTE in both SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client.

**A house with 2 control pads. One is linked to the house. Another one is in your inventory, works as HUD.**

- Put SMC.Client、SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Menu into any PRIM of the house, and turn on the TOUCH.
- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Menu into the linked control pad, and turn on the TOUCH.
- Put SMC.KERNEL、SMC.Menu into the portable control pad HUD.
- Make sure the same LOCAL in both SMC.Client and SMC.KERNEL.
- Make sure the same REMOTE in all the SMC.KERNEL and SMC.Client.

*Attention! **SMC.HUD.TRIGGER** only works with independent **PRIM** buttons **HUD**. It depends on different name and description. It will not work with only one **PRIM**, since it **can not** recognize the touch position **(ST/UV)**. If need such function, you could write your own script.*

## Configure

### .SMC

| Configuration | Type | Value | Default | description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOCAL | integer | -2147483648 ~ 2147483647 (0 无效) | 0 | Local communication channels, mostly used in menu format |
| REMOTE | integer | -10000 ~ 10000 | 0 | Remote Communication Channel Offset（Note: This is private channel offset, not the exact channel），mostly used in HUD format |
| CACHE | integer | 0/1 | 0 | Resource buffer(UUID).If there are a lot of reused images in the configuration, we recommend turnning this. It could save much RAM 
| RANGE | integer | 0/1/2/3 | 0 | Control distance，0:10m, 1:20m, 2:100m, 3:all region |
| LINES | list |  |  | Detailed writing rules will be described below |

#### LINES

**PART**

Part/Target/Picker

- PART is one or many targets (prim & face), which material could be changed.It's also like a picker.
- There must be **4 parameters** after the PART.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "{name}", {matching type}, "{matching text}", {face(es)}
];
```

| Parameters | Type | Value | description |
|---|---|---|---|
| name | string | any | In a set of LINES configurations, it's not repeatable. This is one of the keys to change material. It will also work as option in local menu format |
| matching type | integer | table below | Describe the type of match |
| matching text | string/integer | Name or description for matching, to define with parameter 2 |
| face(es) | string/integer | Which face of the target PRIM. Then number of PRIM(0-7).<br>It could transfer string such as "0267". It will match mutiple face. And no need to follow the order, but can not be repetitive.<br>You can also use ALL_SIDES(-1),and no more face then, since ALL_SIDES include every face

**Matching type**

| Constant | Value | description |
|---|---|---|
| FULL | 0 | Match full text of the PRIM name|
| PREFIX | 1 | Match the prefix of the PRIM name|
| SUFFIX | 2 | Match the suffix of the PRIM name|
| SMART | 3 | Intelligent matching of PRIM names (temporarily unavailable) |
| CONST | 4 | In the manner of constants in SL. The matching text could be: LINK_SET, LINK_ALL_CHILDREN, LINK_ALL_OTHERS, LINK_ROOT, LINK_THIS |
| DFULL | 10 | Match full text of the PRIM description |
| DPREFIX | 11 | Match the prefix of the PRIM description |
| DSUFFIX | 12 | Match the suffix of the PRIM description |
| DSMART | 13 | Intelligent matching of PRIM description (temporarily unavailable) |

**Examples**

Match the **3,4** faces of PRIM with named "**A**".

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "Part A", FULL, "A", "34"
];
```

Match **ALL** faces of the PRIM with prefix named **Rect**.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "All part starting with Rect", PREFIX, "Rect", ALL_SIDES
];
```

Match the **0** face of the PRIM with suffix named **3**.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "All part ending with 3", SUFFIX, "3", 0
];
```

Match the **1、2、5** faces of the "**PRIMs other than the one where the script in**".

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "All others", CONST, LINK_ALL_OTHERS, "125"
];
```

Match **ALL** faces of the PRIM with **description suffix "top"**.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, "TOP", DSUFFIX, "top", ALL_SIDES
];
```

**SET**

Color/Theme/Material scheme

- SET is a material scheme, and free to configure.
- The definition of SET cannot be independent.**It must be behind a part**.
- There are many properties in a SET. The amounts of properties parameters are different.

```lsl
list LINES = [
  PART, ...,
  SET, {property}, ..., {property}, ..., {property}, ...
];
```

## Core KERNEL Local Interface

The message string separator is **"�"**

```lsl
llDumpList2String([...], "�")
```

### Submit

**-643323390**

Apply a predefined property to a predefined part and support custom append and override

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "{PART}�{SET}[�{DATA...}]", "");
```

- PART and SET must be defined in the configuration, and SET must belong to PART for this commit to work.
- The DATA part is an append or override attribute, written as in SET, optional parameters.

Examples

```lsl
// Most commonly used (using predefined configuration LINES)
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "TOP�BLACK", "");
// with customized properties
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "TOP�BLACK�6�<1.0, 0.0, 0.0>�9�TRUE�4�ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c", "");
// Easy style
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, llDumpList2String(["TOP", "BLACK", 6, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, 9, TRUE, 4, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
// It is recommended to use constants, which can be written as
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, llDumpList2String(["TOP", "BLACK", C, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, F, TRUE, S, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
```

\* Batch mode

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "�{SET}", "");
```

- If with no PART, the full match mode will be triggered at this point, and all PARTs containing the SET will be automatically found, and work together.
- The DATA appended at this moment, will be applied to all relevant PARTs.

Examples

```lsl
// In the defined PART, such as TOP, MIDDLE and BOTTOM.
// If there is BLACK in TOP and MIDDLE, those will be found automatically and BLACK will be applied.
// The same with carrying out TOP�BLACK and MIDDLE�BLACK
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323390, "�BLACK", "");
```

**-643323392**

Apply a customized set of attributes to predefined parts

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323392, "{PART}�{DATA...}", "");
```

- PART must have been defined in the configuration for this commit to work.
- The writing style of DATA, such as properties in SET, is different with those above for the custom properties of PART.

Examples

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323392, "TOP�6�<1.0, 0.0, 0.0>�9�TRUE�4�ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c", "");
// Easy style
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323392, llDumpList2String(["TOP", 6, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, 9, TRUE, 4, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
// It is recommended to use constants, which can be written as
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323392, llDumpList2String(["TOP", C, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, F, TRUE, S, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
```

**-643323393**

Apply a set of custom properties to a customized part.

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323393, "{DATA...}", "");
```

- DATA must be with the full PART + SET contents.
- No need to follow the configuration, this is a completely independent selection + properties rule.

Examples

```lsl
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323393, "2�top�0123�6�<1.0, 0.0, 0.0>�9�TRUE�4�ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c", "");
// Easy style
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323393, llDumpList2String([2, "top", "0123", 6, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, 9, TRUE, 4, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
// It is recommended to use constants, which can be written as
llMessageLinked(LINK_SET, -643323393, llDumpList2String([SUFFIX, "top", "0123", C, <1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, F, TRUE, S, "ee509dfd-0974-6fb5-3eea-2504fa13ef4c"], "�"), "");
```
